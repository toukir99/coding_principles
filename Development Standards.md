# Software Engineering Best Practices

## 1. Consistent Coding Style
- Use linters and formatters.
- Follow [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

## 2. Comments
Write meaningful comments that explain the purpose of functions, classes, and complex logic, aiding comprehension for others and your future self.

## 3. Robustness
- **Defensive Programming**: Anticipate and handle potential failures or invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Error Handling**: Use structured error handling to manage exceptions.
- **Resource Management**: Ensure proper allocation and release of resources like memory, files, and database connections.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Account for unusual or extreme inputs and scenarios during development.
- **Adherence to SOLID Principles**: Follow design principles to create maintainable and predictable systems.
- **Testing**: Rigorously test for functional, unit, integration, and boundary conditions.
- **Code Clarity**: Write clear, understandable, and maintainable code to reduce the likelihood of bugs.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Log critical information and monitor systems to detect and diagnose issues early.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Allow the system to continue partial operations even in case of a failure.

## 4. SOLID Principles
- **S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Keep each class focused on one responsibility.
- **O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Code (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes should work interchangeably with their base types.
- **I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces that it does not use; use specific, smaller interfaces instead.
- **D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on low-level modules. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## 5. Make Testing Easy
Design code that supports easy testing:
- **Regression Testing**: Verifies recent changes havenâ€™t broken existing functionality.
- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validates the entire workflow from start to finish.
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic checks to ensure application still works after a new build.
- **API and Integration Testing**: Tests interactions between APIs and modules.
- **Performance Testing**: Assesses speed, stability, and scalability under load.
- **Security Testing**: Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Confirms the system meets business requirements.
- **User I/O Testing**: Tests user inputs and outputs for correctness and usability.

## 6. Abstraction
Simplify complex logic by exposing only essential features, hiding unnecessary implementation details.

## 7. Utilize Design Patterns but Don't Over-Design
Use proven solutions (e.g., Singleton, Factory, MVC, State) to common problems, but avoid unnecessary complexity.

## 8. Reduce Global Dependencies
Minimize shared state and global variables to improve modularity and prevent unintended side effects.

## 9. Continuous Refactoring
Regularly improve code structure and quality without altering its behavior to maintain long-term maintainability.

## 10. Security is a Top Priority
Protect data and systems from vulnerabilities by implementing authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure coding practices.
